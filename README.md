MusicTraining Proyect Java created by Dylanrod159.

This is a "basic" music project based in Spotify, created 100% in Java. Feel free to use (do not forget the credits!).

ABOUT THE PROJECT:

For now the project is 80% in English and 20% in Spanish (that means some variables, methods, outputs or classes are in spanish),
however, in the future it will be 100% in English.

The "Bandoleros.wav" file is a song that I used as an example to show how to upload a song to the database.

The "mtbd.sql" file is the database I used to make this project (you can use xampp to connect to the database as I did).

If you use xampp you have to follow these steps to make it work correctly:
1. Open xampp control panel
2. Click in Apache's config
3. Click in PHP (php.ini)
4. In the PHP file search for "memory_limit="
5. Change the value to at least 3000M (or 4096M as I did at that moment)
6. Save the file and you can start Apache and MySQL
